# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework
Branching in git can be used as a tools for collaboration.
Merge is an action of combining 2 different branches. Used to move our work changes from one branch to another branch (usually the main/ master branch)

I also learnt about git signatur using gpg key to verify the user who makes the commit.

challenges: none, the sharing session are delivered smoothly & in an easy to understand manner.
